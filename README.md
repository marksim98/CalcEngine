# CalcEngine
##A Calcuator engine made entirely from Java
Over a period of two weeks, I used the IntelliJ IDE to build a Java-based calculator. Originally, this app used conditional statements and for/while loops to manage calculations. However, I was able to take advantage of class inheritance, building abstract relationships with interfaces, as well as including exception handling to upgrade my application.
